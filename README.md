# Chest_X-Ray_Image_Classification
Postgraduate Project Implementation for "Chest X-Ray Image Classification using Deep Learning networks"

# ABOUT: 
At the forefront of chest x-ray analysis, it is vital
for a radiologist to promptly identify abnormalities within the
thoracic region to correctly diagnose a patient, thus figuring out
the best treatments available. Unfortunately, traditional
diagnosis can be susceptible to the issue of human error, which
can stem from a memory-based lapse in an individualâ€™s
knowledge or from a genuine mistake on their part. Image-based classification using deep learning solutions have the
potential to automate this process, whilst providing a better
diagnosis accuracy and mitigating the issue of human error, to
some degree. This task has been, and also remains as one of the
more challenging tasks within the field of automated healthcare
diagnosis, as deep learning is inherently weakly supervised.
